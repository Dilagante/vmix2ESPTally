# VmixToESPTally

A simple firmware for ESP8266 Boards to make a portable Tally Light System!

### What are Tally Lights?

Tally Lights are used in the broadcasting world to let Camera Operators know when their feed is currently on Program or Preview, giving them a heads up on when they're On Air, or about to be (On Preview).

### How does this Project work?

This project is meant to be flashed to an ESP8266 Board, with one board being used for each instance where a tally light is needed. (Multiple lights from One Board Coming Soon?)

The Board is assigned to an input number (or GUID), connects to WiFi, pings the Vmix API (found at https://[vmix_machine_ip]:8088/api) to see if the input number given is in the <preview> or <active> tag. If so, it sets the color of the LEDs connected to GPIO Pins.


## Features

- Allows Input Reference by Input Number *or* Input GUID
- Comprehensive(ish) Debugging WiFi Status and Current Preview & Program Numbers over Serial
- Allows assignment of the Board to a static IP
- View Tally Status using a 4 Pin RGB LED (Neopixel Version Coming Soon!)

## Config

The config.h file in src is used to set the;
- WiFi SSID
- WiFi Password
-  Vmix Machine IP (With Port)
- Input Number OR GUID
- Pins used for LEDs (Wiring Diagram for Default Config is given below)
- (Optional) Static IP, Gateway, and Subnet for the board

### Should I use an Input Number or it's GUID. Also, what's a GUID

A GUID is a unique identifier for an input in Vmix. Rearranging inputs will not affect the GUID. Therefore, it's a reliable way to ensure that you always point to the correct Input. 

To find an input's GUID, you can go to the Vmix API XML (Found at ```http://[Vmix_Machine_IP]:[Port]/api```), and find the GUID corresponding the Input you need.

You can use either the Input Number or GUID with no change to the code.
## Installation

### Method 1: Using PlatformIO in Visual Studio Code

- Clone the repo on your Machine with;
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Dilagante/vmix2ESPTally
```
    
- Connect your ESP8266 Board over USB
- In the PlatformIO Tab of VSCode, open the folder containing the platformio.ini file
- Make any changes necessary in the config.h file (Vmix Machine IP, WiFi Credentials, etc.)
- Upload to your Board!

## What's next?

- ESP32 Support (May work, currently untested)
- Separate version with Neopixel support (A single data pin to control an LED Strip like WS2812)
- Control multiple light strips from one board (Unpractical unless Cameras/Feeds are right next to each other but let's see)

## Libraries Used

- [ESP8266WiFi.h](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/)
- [ESP8266HTTPClient.h](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/ESP8266HTTPClient/)
